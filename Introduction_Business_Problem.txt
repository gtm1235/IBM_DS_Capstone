Statement of Data Analytics Problem:
	My fianc√©e, an Internal Medicine Resident, and I will be relocating at the end of her residency. I am pursuing a career change in software engineering. I will most likely be moving early in pursuit of my career change.  I would like to apply to jobs in a location that most fits our needs and preferences for a community.
	We chose five cities to start with:

1.	Dallas, TX
2.	Austin, TX
3.	Chicago, IL
4.	Jacksonville, FL
5.	San Diego, CA

There will be two parts to this analysis:

1)	Find the neighborhoods across these cities that most closely match our favorite locations around the US in regards to venues and culture:
	a.	West Palm Beach, FL
	b.	La Jolla, CA
	c.	Portland, ME
	d.	Downtown Chicago, IL

2)	Further segment the neighborhoods by demographics within the zip codes such as:
	a.	Compensation in both the Medicine and Software Engineering fields.
	b.	Commute time to work.
	c.	Median Income in location.
	d.	Housing cost and availability.

By using available data we hope to find a list of the top 5 choices overall as well as the top choice in each city.
