Current Jupyter Notebook link and filtered data sets (if github link int working please use nbviewer)
a) https://github.com/gtm1235/IBM_DS_Capstone/blob/master/moving_challenge.ipynb
or
https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/gtm1235/IBM_DS_Capstone/blob/master/moving_challenge.ipynb
b) https://github.com/gtm1235/IBM_DS_Capstone/blob/master/austin_filtered.csv
c) https://github.com/gtm1235/IBM_DS_Capstone/blob/master/chicago_filtered.csv

In order to solve the problem we must acquire a variety of data sets:
1) Lists of neighborhoods in the required cities. This data will be acquired from two sources:
a. Wikipedia.com
i. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_communities_and_neighborhoods_of_San_Diego
ii. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Austin_neighborhoods
iii. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_neighborhoods_in_Dallas
iv. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_neighborhoods_in_Chicago
b. Conservopedia.com
i. https://www.conservapedia.com/Neighborhoods_of_Jacksonville,_Florida

I was able to find 4 of the 5 cities on Wikipedia, however, I had to search additional sources for data on Jacksonville,FL neighborhoods. We will use a variety of webscraping tools to extract the table data. These include:
1) Pd.read_html – table extraction tool for html based data
2) BeautifulSoup4 – an htm parsing tool
3) Requests – http request module
4) Numpy – matrix manipulation tool
5) Pandas – series and dataframe manipulation tool

2) Latitude, Longitude and zip code geolocation data: this data will be obtained from gooles geolocation API using the requests module. Python example:
	url=’https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?latlng={},
	{}&key={}'.format(neighborhoods['Latitude'][i], neighborhoods['Longitude'][i],api_key)



3) Zip code Demographics will be obtained from zipwho.com. A website that offers a variety of data such as median income, housing costs, cost of living index, housing, education, and more. Using BeautifulSoup4 and requests, I will extract the relevant data. Python example:
	url_zip = 'https://zipwho.com/?zip={}-&city=&filters=--_--_--_--	&state=&mode=zip'.format(neighborhood_zip['zip_code'][i])
	
4) Location data describing venues in the area that give a feel for the lifestyle available in the  venue.  A list of venue categories can be found at : https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/resources/categories
Python url example:
url='https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/explore?&client_id={}&client_secret={}&v={}&ll={},{}&radius={}&limit={}'.format(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, VERSION, neighborhood_latitude, neighborhood_longitude, radius, LIMIT)


5)  Additional zip code data including average commute time and location based industry income 
Were found at 2 location in csv format.
