In order to solve the problem we must acquire a variety of data sets:
1) Lists of neighborhoods in the required cities. This data will be acquired from two sources:
a. Wikipedia.com
i. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_communities_and_neighborhoods_of_San_Diego
ii. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Austin_neighborhoods
iii. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_neighborhoods_in_Dallas
iv. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_neighborhoods_in_Chicago
b. Conservopedia.com
i. https://www.conservapedia.com/Neighborhoods_of_Jacksonville,_Florida

I was able to find 4 of the 5 cities on Wikipedia, however, I had to search additional sources for data on Jacksonville,FL neighborhoods. We will use a variety of webscraping tools to extract the table data. These include:
1) Pd.read_html – table extraction tool for html based data
2) BeautifulSoup4 – an htm parsing tool
3) Requests – http request module
4) Numpy – matrix manipulation tool
5) Pandas – series and dataframe manipulation tool

2) Latitude, Longitude and zip code geolocation data
